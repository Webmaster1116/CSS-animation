# learn-css-animation
As a beginner to CSS animations, I have learned some cool things and made a photo gallery üñºÔ∏è. This project repo is all about sharing that knowledge with you with a step-by-step approach. Hope you find it useful.

‚úã Feel free to follow this project as I keep updating the source code. If it was useful to you, show your support with a star ‚≠ê

Please feel free to clone the repo and try running it locally. This project is also deployed with `Netlify` and you can see it running from here,
